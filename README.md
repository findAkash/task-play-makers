## description

'''
We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle. Create a function taking a png as input and verifying that:

- Size = 512x512

- The only non transparent pixels are within a circle

- The colors in the badge give a "happy" feeling

Additionally, you can create a parallel function that converts the given image (of any format) into the specified object.
